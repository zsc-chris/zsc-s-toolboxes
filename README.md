This two toolboxs provides utilities that help simplify data processing, numerical simulations and toolbox development of MATLAB.

这两个工具箱提供实用功能，以简化MATLAB数据处理、数值模拟和工具箱开发。

The most highlighted invention would be dimension-named matrix (dnm) class, which allows matlab users to easily manage dimensions (for example, the y x z dimension order for an image; and also when you use matlab tensor toolbox), which also generalizes a lot of MATLAB functions so that they are suitable for any dimension inputs. Such class seems to be the first among the internet.

全网首发DNM震撼登场！dnm可以给矩阵的每个维度命名，从此告别记忆对第几个维度进行运算的烦恼，直接指定维度名称即可！

I do not promise the correctness of all tools (especially the numerical toolbox). May update (This is not a software, so I will not considering compatibility.) when I want to update (will always say initial commit).
